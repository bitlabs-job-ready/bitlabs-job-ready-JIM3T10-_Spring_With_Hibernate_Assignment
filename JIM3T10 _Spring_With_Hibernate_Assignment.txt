1. Create a simple Spring MVC application with a few controllers and service classes.

2. Use the @Autowired annotation to inject dependencies into the controllers and service classes.

3. Experiment with different autowiring modes, such as byType and byName, and see how they affect the way dependencies are injected.

4. Use the @Qualifier annotation to disambiguate between multiple beans of the same type.

5. Use the @Component annotation to create custom components that can be autowired into other beans.

6. Use the @Value annotation to inject values from application properties into beans.

7. Use the @Bean annotation to define custom beans in a @Configuration class.

8. Use the @Scope annotation to control the lifecycle of beans and the way they are shared between different clients.
